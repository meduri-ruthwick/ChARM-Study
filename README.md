# ChARM: Cross-Species Prediction of Open Chromatin Regions Using Sequence Features

## üìò Overview

This repository hosts the scripts, models, and data associated with my M.Tech thesis, which investigates the evolution and sequence determinants of open chromatin regions across vertebrates using human ATAC-seq data. The central goal is to explore whether chromatin accessibility can be inferred from primary DNA sequence alone and how these patterns evolve across species.

## üß¨ Background

ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing) provides high-resolution data on open chromatin regions. While extensively used in human and model organisms, understanding the **evolutionary conservation** of chromatin accessibility patterns remains an open question.

---

## üéØ Objective

- Identify sequence-level determinants of chromatin accessibility using ATAC-seq data from humans.
- Develop a predictive model capable of identifying open chromatin from DNA sequence alone.
- Extend these predictions across **105 vertebrate genomes** to explore the evolutionary conservation of chromatin openness.
- Evaluate functional enrichment and evolutionary signals, especially focusing on primate-specific transposons (e.g., **Alu subfamilies**).

## üîç Methodology

### 1. Data Collection

- **ATAC-seq data** for human samples was obtained and high-confidence open chromatin peaks were selected.
- Corresponding **background regions** (non-accessible chromatin) were also collected for model training.

### 2. Feature Extraction

- Sequence windows around each region were analyzed.
- Extracted features include:
  - k-mer frequencies
  - GC content
  - Sequence entropy
  - Repeat content (if available)
- These were compiled into class 0 (closed chromatin) and class 1 (open chromatin) datasets.

### 3. Model Development: ChARM

- A **Random Forest Classifier** was developed to distinguish between accessible and inaccessible chromatin regions.
- The model was trained using:
  - Stratified cross-validation
  - Feature importance analysis
- Performance was evaluated using confusion matrices, accuracy, precision, and recall scores.

### 4. Cross-Species Prediction

- The trained model (**ChARM**) was applied to **105 vertebrate genomes**.
- Predicted open chromatin regions (`pAERs`: **predicted ATAC-Enriched Regions**) were filtered based on model confidence.

### 5. Phylogenetic Analysis

- All true predictions across species were aligned with a phylogenetic framework to trace:
  - Conserved open regions
  - Divergence in chromatin patterns
  - Gain/loss of accessibility traits through evolution

### 6. Primate-Specific Alu Analysis

- Investigated the presence of **Alu subfamilies** within predicted open chromatin regions in **primates**.
- Assessed the relationship between Alu insertion patterns and predicted chromatin accessibility.
- Early findings suggest a **subfamily-specific contribution** to functional accessibility in primates.
